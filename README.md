}

## sh files 
SL.sh runs SL_python.py -> sbatch SL.sh

DeepRL.sh runs DeepRL.py -> sbatch DeepRL.sh

new_script.sh has all the necessary commands to install libraries using anaconda.

## AI data 

Notebook used to generate the data is found in the AI_generated_data folder -> has link to google colab
